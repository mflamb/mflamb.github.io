        <h1>Mike Lamb
          <small>crazy about growth</small>
        </h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Mike. I'm a web developer with a natural inclination to solve complex problems. </p>
        <p>I'm curious about the kinds of things that most people find inaccessible and forbidding.</p>
        <p>I'm the kind of guy who goes into Postgres manually and starts teaching himself SQL commands for fun.</p>
        <p>I'm the guy who fell in love with Git and the Command Line from day one.</p>
        <p>I thrive on a formidable challenge. I strive to continually seek out greater ones in my professional endeavors because
          I love the growth that comes under scary conditions.</p>
        <p> I discovered a love of coding completely by accident. At my last job as a Navy SAP Support Contractor, I was taking
          Excel tutorials to level up my skills when I got exposed to writing macros with VBA. Having been an English major
          in college, I was always fascinated by the structure of language and how subtle changes to it can have such vastly
          different impacts.</p>
        <p>Over the next six months my interest grew increasingly serious, and I took tutorials ranging from the fundamentals
          of
          <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/logic-and-computational-thinking">"Logic and Computational Thinking"</a> all the way to Ruby and JavaScript beginner courses.</p>
        <p>Since that time, I've been committed to dedicating my professional life to the pursuit of developing and perfecting
          a true craft. </p>

          need. It also makes the information easily accessible for donors.</p>

        <p>It wasn't enough for me to take my project idea to Code for Philly's 2018 Launchpad Hackathon and build it with a
          team: I wanted to build the idea on my own at the same time, so I could learn every aspect of what it took. I built
          a GeoJSON API from my database for the map display, and used two Devise models to create Admin and User layers.</p>

        <p>An apartment search website designed to allow users to take a deeper look at specific areas within the city of Philadelphia.  This began as a one-week group project with a four-person team using OpenLayers and four different APIs displayed as toggleable layers on a map of the city.  Two of the APIs were from "http" sites, which created compatibility problems and required a specific Google Chrome extension for the layers to function properly.  After our bootcamp ended, I revisited Philly Grid and swapped out the incompatible APIs for new ones.  I also used the Rubillow gem to pull in the Zillow API and enable the apartment search capability, complete with more detailed demographic information about the surrounding neighborhood.</p>

        <p>An early JavaScript project based on the hangman or Wheel of Fortune style of game. While this project was an achievement
          at the time and it is fully functional, note that comparing the code to the searchCloud project shows a lot of
          growth that happened in only two weeks between the two projects.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>On Friday I knew nothing about the Foundation CSS Framework. By Monday I'd used it to build this site. It's definitely
          a refreshing change of pace from Bootstrap in terms of visual aesthetic. It also lends itself much more easily
          to customization.</p>

        <p>A deep dive into the native capabilities of NodeJS using absolutely ZERO 3rd-party libraries or frameworks. It's

          demonstrating just how much can be done without the need for dependencies.</p>
