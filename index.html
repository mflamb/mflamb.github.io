      <h1>Mike Lamb
        <small>crazy about growth</small>
      </h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Mike.  I'm a web developer with a natural inclination to solve complex problems. </p>
      <p>I'm curious about the kinds of things that most people find inaccessible and forbidding.</p>
      <p>I'm the kind of guy who goes into Postgres manually and starts teaching himself SQL commands for fun.</p>
      <p>I'm the guy who fell in love with Git and the Command Line from day one.</p>
      <p>I thrive on a formidable challenge.  I strive to continually seek out greater ones in my professional endeavors because I love the growth that comes under scary conditions.</p>
      <p> I discovered a love of coding completely by accident.  At my last job as a Navy SAP Support Contractor, I was taking Excel tutorials to level up my skills when I got exposed to writing macros with VBA.  Having been an English major in college, I was always fascinated by the structure of language and how subtle changes to it can have such vastly different impacts.</p>
      <p>Over the next six months my interest grew increasingly serious, and I took tutorials ranging from the fundamentals of <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/logic-and-computational-thinking">"Logic and Computational Thinking"</a> all the way to Ruby and JavaScript beginner courses.</p>
      <p>Since that time, I've been committed to dedicating my professional life to the pursuit of developing and perfecting a true craft.  </p>

      <p>Winner of Code for Philly's 2018 Month-long Launchpad Hackathon. I serve as Project Lead and developer for this open
        source web app designed to enable charity organizations to let the community know what items they most urgently need.
        It also makes the information easily accessible for donors.</p>

      <a href="https://github.com/mflamb/direct-effect" class="success button hollow">GitHub Repo</a>
      <p>It wasn't enough for me to take my project idea to Code for Philly's 2018 Launchpad Hackathon and build it with a team:
        I wanted to build the idea on my own at the same time, so I could learn every aspect of what it took. I built a GeoJSON
        API from my database for the map display, and used two Devise models to create Admin and User layers.</p>

      <a href="https://github.com/mflamb/soundcloud-api-jukebox" class="success button hollow">GitHub Repo</a>
      <p>A searchable custom jukebox powered by Soundcloud's REST API. Users can search by keyword for songs, play a song and
        display artist/track information with a click. It was designed so that song selection wouldn't depend on iterating
        through an array. This project has a special place in my heart because it was my breakthrough with writing clean
        JavaScript for the first time!</p>

      <a href="https://github.com/mflamb/capstone" class="success button hollow">GitHub Repo</a>
      <p>An early JavaScript project based on the hangman or Wheel of Fortune style of game. While this project was an achievement
        at the time and it is fully functional, note that comparing the code to the searchCloud project shows a lot of growth
        that happened in only two weeks between the two projects.</p>

      <p>On Friday I knew nothing about the Foundation CSS Framework.  By Monday I'd used it to build this site.  It's definitely a refreshing change of pace from Bootstrap in terms of visual aesthetic.  It also lends itself much more easily to customization.</p>

      <p>A deep dive into the native capabilities of NodeJS using absolutely ZERO 3rd-party libraries or frameworks.  It's well-known that NPM is bloated with redundant packages, but this course aims at teaching true mastery of Node by demonstrating just how much can be done without the need for dependencies.</p>
